    <p class="h1-subheadline">Prevent damage before it happens</p>


    <div class="how-it-works">
     
        <p class="h2-subheadline">When something breaks, you should not have to spend your afternoon calling random contractors or reading reviews. Because we already manage your home profile, we can diagnose issues faster and deploy a trusted technician immediately. We skip the hassle of scheduling initial estimates and get straight to the fix so you can get back to your life.</p>

                <h3>Fence Repair</h3>
                <p>Water damage is the most common and costly home insurance claim. We place smart sensors in high-risk zones—like under sinks, water heaters, and washing machines. If even a single drop of water is detected, our system alerts us instantly, allowing us to stop a small leak before it becomes a disastrous flood.</p>

                <h3>P-Trap Cleaning</h3>
                <p>These are the backbone of our system. Temperature sensors in the attic can alert us to energy improvments that can be made. We compare your attic temperature to other homes in our network.</p>

                <h3>Machine Repair</h3>
                <p>We monitor "at-risk" areas 24/7 to catch moisture issues early. By analyzing long-term patterns, our system detects abnormal humidity levels instantly, preventing costly water damage and mold growth.</p>

                <h3>Drywall Patch</h3>
                <p>Radon is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. In Los Angeles, 
  seismic activity and nearby construction can unlock radon pockets unexpectedly. 
  Some might call continuous monitoring overkill, but it's what I do in my own home. 
  We don't rely on the EPA's "every 2 years" minimum; we test 24/7 so you are 
  alerted the moment air quality drops.</p>

                <h3>The Hub</h3>
                <p>This small device is the brain of the operation. It quietly collects data from every sensor in your home—from the attic to the basement—and analyzes it 24/7. We designed it to be completely unobtrusive: no blinking lights, no beeping speakers, and no distractions. It sits silently in the background, ensuring your home is safe without you ever noticing it's there.</p>

                <p>High water bills are often caused by "silent" wastes—like a running toilet, a stuck irrigation valve, or a dripping faucet. Instead of waiting for a surprise bill, our system monitors flow patterns to identify leaks and inefficiencies instantly, saving you money every month.</p>

                <h3>HVAC Pressure Monitoring (coming soon)</h3>
                <p>The standard advice to change filters "every 3-6 months" is just a guess. It doesn’t account for pets, allergies, or heavy usage during heatwaves. We monitor the actual pressure inside your ducts to tell you exactly when your filter is clogged. This ensures maximum air quality without wasting money on filters you don't need yet.</p>
