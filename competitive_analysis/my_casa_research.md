# Research on my.casa pricing and business strategy

## What my.casa appears to be

The public site at my.casa is currently a simple waitlist page.

Behind that, their Member Terms describe a paid membership or subscription that bundles services for the home such as a home inventorying process, access to a concierge, coordinating visits from service providers, package pickup, and procurement of third party products.

They also describe using third party AI tools to automate parts of diagnosing home issues and some customer support.

## Pricing signals

### Reported headline price

Multiple independent posts that replicate the same product description state the membership costs $199 per month, and that it is in private beta with limited availability. One scraped copy includes these details.

1. $199 per month  
2. 90 minutes of handyman time per month  
3. weekly package and return pickups  
4. scheduled maintenance tasks, examples include air filters, washer dryer, garage door  
5. 3D model and inventory of the home  
6. help handling property taxes  
7. vendor recommendations plus payment and coordination  
8. constraints noted, Bay Area only, owned single family homes, iOS only, private beta  

Important nuance: I did not find $199 published directly on my.casa itself. The strongest first party documents available publicly are the Terms and Privacy Policy, which confirm subscription billing but not the specific price.

### How $199 positions them economically

Using recent industry benchmarks, typical handyman hourly rates often fall in the rough range of $65 to $125, with a broader range often cited as $50 to $150 depending on market and specialization.

If you value 90 minutes of handyman time at $65 per hour, that is $97.50.  
At $125 per hour, that is $187.50.

So at $199 per month, the handyman minutes alone can plausibly anchor the perceived value, while leaving only a small implied margin unless:

1. many customers underuse the included minutes, gym model dynamics  
2. they procure labor below retail through routing, batching, and contracted supply  
3. the handyman work is limited to a narrow set of tasks with predictable duration  
4. upsells and add ons are common  

## What the first party documents reveal about monetization

Even without a published price, the Terms strongly suggest multiple revenue streams beyond a flat membership.

### 1. Subscription plus credits

The Terms mention subscriptions and also credits that can be included as a membership benefit or purchased, and whose redemption value can vary. That is a classic structure for bundling a baseline plan plus metered add ons.

### 2. Payments layer and potential take rate

They describe enabling payments to third party service providers through the service, and they also describe managed services where Casa takes responsibility for vendor management and payments, with the customer owing Casa directly under that arrangement.

This opens room for:

1. invoice processing or bill pay fees  
2. vendor margin or negotiated discounts  
3. convenience fees for managed procurement  

### 3. Advertising and partnerships

The Terms explicitly reserve the right to display third party ads.

The Privacy Policy also mentions affiliate partners and paid affiliate programs, and sharing data with vendors and prospective vendors as part of providing services. That combination points toward partnerships and referrals as a meaningful long term revenue lever.

## Business strategy inferred from their design choices

### Target customer and wedge

Everything points to a high trust, high convenience wedge aimed at affluent owner occupied homes, initially in a dense, high income metro. The repeated owned single family homes plus Bay Area constraint supports that positioning.

That segment is attractive because:

1. higher willingness to pay for time savings  
2. higher lifetime value  
3. higher attach rates for bigger projects once trust is earned  

### Product thesis: become the home operating system

Two first party elements support this.

1. Home inventorying plus ongoing enrichment from public records and device data  
2. Broad permissions to manage the home and coordinate vendors, plus the data they collect about the home including photos, videos, and even wifi credentials  

This is consistent with building a durable data asset about the home and its maintenance history, which increases switching costs over time.

### Operational model: managed marketplace, not a pure marketplace

They repeatedly frame third party providers as third party service providers and disclaim responsibility for their conduct, which is typical for a coordination layer.

At the same time, they also describe managed services where Casa takes on vendor management and payments, which is closer to being the general contractor for ongoing maintenance.

The likely strategy is a hybrid:

1. start with a concierge that coordinates  
2. selectively internalize the most common, low risk jobs into a repeatable playbook  
3. keep complex or regulated work in a partner network  

### Scaling strategy: AI to reduce concierge cost per home

They explicitly reference AI outputs used for automated diagnosis and certain customer support, and the Privacy Policy lists AI providers such as OpenAI among service providers. That suggests a cost curve goal: keep a premium feel while reducing human time per request.

### Growth strategy: waitlist and referral loops

The public landing page is just a waitlist.

The circulated invite code mechanic suggests controlled rollout and demand shaping, which also helps operations match supply to demand while they learn.

## Strategic risks and pressure points

1. Unit economics risk: bundling physical labor inside a flat subscription is hard unless usage is low or heavily standardized  
2. Trust and liability risk: they seek broad access to the home, sometimes without the homeowner present, and they collect sensitive home data  
3. Market expansion risk: moving beyond a dense metro often breaks routing efficiency for handyman minutes and pickups  
4. Partner quality risk: they disclaim responsibility for third party providers, but the customer will still attribute outcomes to Casa  

## Practical takeaways on their pricing and packaging

If the $199 per month report is accurate, the pricing is doing three jobs at once.

1. Anchor value with a concrete monthly labor allowance  
2. Sell peace of mind via scheduled preventive maintenance  
3. Create a platform for higher margin attach through vendor coordination, procurement, and payments  

A likely next step as they mature is tiering.

1. a base plan focused on a digital twin plus concierge  
2. a mid tier with included handyman minutes  
3. a top tier with more minutes plus faster service levels plus seasonal inspections  

with credits or add ons for overflow.
