# Kurahome.com pricing and business strategy research

Date captured: January 19, 2026

## What Kurahome appears to be
Kurahome positions itself less like an on demand handyman marketplace and more like a recurring home maintenance service paired with specialty HVAC adjacent cleaning. The core offering emphasizes quarterly visits where a homeowner selects from a checklist of routine tasks. They also promote add on services such as air duct cleaning, dryer vent cleaning, and AC cleaning.

## Pricing model and observed price points

### Quarterly routine home maintenance plan
Kurahome frames this as a subscription style program with quarterly visits and a customizable, a la carte task list.

Observed pricing guidance on their own FAQ

* Most average sized homes run about 199 to 399 per quarter
* Pricing varies based on which checklist items you choose and how many of each item exist in the home, such as furnaces, bathrooms, AC units, dryers

Contract and retention positioning

* They state customers are not locked into a contract
* They cite retention above 95 percent as the reason they do not require a contract

Labor model

* They state workers are W2 employees and they do not use subcontractors

### Air duct cleaning pricing
On site messaging emphasizes transparent pricing, counting vents, and confirming the price before work starts.

A third party listing on Thumbtack provides a concrete pricing structure

* 29.99 per vent plus tax
* 449.85 minimum, which includes the first 15 vents

They also market bundles and promos

* Air duct cleaning promos are referenced on their site, for example an offer of up to 99 off the service with details provided during booking
* They state dryer vent cleaning is included with every air duct cleaning service

Their content also sets expectations that a full duct cleaning for a mid sized home can land in the 400 to 1,000 range, framed as an argument against very cheap specials.

### Dryer vent cleaning pricing
They publish an explicit range for their own dryer vent service

* 139.99 to 250 depending on setup and location

## General business strategy signals

### Recurring revenue first, not one off jobs
The quarterly cadence is designed to create predictable repeat visits and support retention. They highlight quarterly visits and a checklist of services, and they frame the offer as ongoing maintenance rather than one time repairs.

### Positioning focused on trust and consistency
They repeatedly differentiate themselves from cheap specials and informal labor by emphasizing the following

* Transparent, upfront pricing and price confirmation before work begins
* W2 staffing and no subcontractors
* Heavy emphasis on reviews and reputation

### Two sided offering: membership style maintenance plus higher ticket specialty services
The quarterly plan anchors the relationship. Duct cleaning and dryer vent cleaning appear positioned as higher value add ons and seasonal triggers. They also mention commercial maintenance and multifamily property maintenance, which suggests a path for expansion beyond single family homeowners.

### Go to market: SEO and education driven demand capture
Kurahome publishes educational content around duct cleaning, dryer vent safety, costs, and scam avoidance. This supports demand capture for high intent search queries and can funnel one time service buyers into quarterly subscribers.

### Expansion strategy: licensing and franchising
Kurahome promotes licensing and franchising as growth vehicles, highlighting recurring revenue as part of the model. Third party franchise portals list fees and investment ranges that appear to be based on an FDD, but those numbers should be treated as directional until verified with the current FDD.

## Strategic risks and checks that matter

1. Duct cleaning category risk  
   Duct cleaning demand can be cyclical, and consumer guidance often warns against exaggerated claims. Clear expectation setting matters for conversion and retention.

2. Labor model tradeoffs  
   Using employees instead of subcontractors can improve quality control but may increase fixed costs, making route density and scheduling efficiency critical.

3. Local pricing variability  
   Public pricing signals vary by market and channel, including per vent pricing, minimums, and quote mechanisms. Expect local variation and confirm current pricing for the target service area.

## One view summary

### Pricing
* Quarterly plan: about 199 to 399 per quarter for an average sized home, varying by selected tasks and home counts
* Air duct cleaning: third party listing indicates 29.99 per vent with a 449.85 minimum that includes the first 15 vents, while the site emphasizes vent counting and confirming the price before work begins
* Dryer vent cleaning: 139.99 to 250, and it is often bundled with air duct cleaning

### Strategy
* Build a recurring quarterly maintenance relationship
* Position on trust, transparency, and consistent in house labor
* Use educational content and SEO to capture demand, then upsell and retain via membership
* Scale through licensing and franchising
