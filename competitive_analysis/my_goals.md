# Handyman Business Goals

## Overview
I am a handyman in Los Angeles. I also program on the side. I can create apps and setup smart homes.

## Goals

- Create a new business that is different from standard hourly billing.
- Make as much money as possible.
- Use as little of my physical labor as possible.
- Leverage technology such as leak detector sensors to help "watch" people's homes remotely.  
- Ideally, this would be the whole business and I would only respond to homes when a sensor went off.
- Grow the business without much money, ideally using Meta ads.
- Only work in wealthy neighborhoods near me, mainly around Hancock Park, Los Angeles and south of that.



## Other Considerations

- There’s an aspect to the sensors that I think will appeal to Orthodox Jews: if a sensor goes off on Shabbat, I can come to their home without them asking. However I don't know if I can sell that as the only service at first? I'm not sure. Maybe this is the end state of the business, but in the meantime I will likely need to do actual handyman work.

- There are already handyman services on the market such as my.casa and honeyhomes.com. What can I offer my rich customers that the others can’t? I'm much more than a handyman and CAN do other higher order tasks but I don't want to get trapped into trading time for money. 

- People are quicker to pay for one off tasks than they are recurring services. 

- I have ADHD so planning and scheduling is quite difficult for me. 

## Possible offerings

- Guarantee I'll visit their house in an emargeny within 1 hr, or they don't pay for the month. 
- After hours emergencies cost more?

- Tier 1: $99 per task? (gets people in the door to sell them the subscription)

- Tier 2: $400 / month. This is for remote monitoring of their sensnors, and a bi-weekly or monthly house checkup.
