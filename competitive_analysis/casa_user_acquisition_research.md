# How Casa (my.casa) is finding new users

Here is what I can piece together about how Casa at my.casa is getting new users right now, based on what is publicly visible.

## What Casa is selling, in plain terms

Casa is positioning itself as an app powered personal property manager for single family homeowners. It is currently gated behind a waitlist on the main site.

Public posts from early users describe benefits like package pickup, on demand handyman help, and home inventory features.

## The acquisition system they are using today

### 1. Invite and referral loop, powered by happy beta members

Multiple public posts from individuals say they are in a beta, there is a waitlist, and they share a personal link to get access. That is a classic viral invite mechanic where existing members become a distribution channel.

Why it works for this business:

* Trust is the whole game for letting a service into your home, so warm intros convert better than cold ads
* A waitlist plus invites creates scarcity and status, which boosts sharing and follow through

### 2. Founder and operator social, amplified by tastemaker accounts

A prominent example is Lenny Rachitsky posting enthusiastically about the service and what you get for the monthly price. Even a single post like this can drive a surge of high intent signups, especially in the Bay Area tech homeowner demographic.

You also see the same pattern in smaller circles: professionals posting that they are using it, they love it, and sharing a link for others to try.

Practical takeaway: their early growth looks heavily driven by organic word of mouth inside tech networks, not broad consumer marketing.

### 3. Geographic wedge: local city launches with real operations behind them

Their hiring makes it clear this is not a purely digital product. They run in home onboarding visits to build a detailed home profile, including inventories and scans.

That operational reality strongly suggests a city by city rollout, where they can staff field teams and build vendor coverage before opening the floodgates.

Signals for where they are focusing:

* San Francisco is the stated location for their growth leadership role
* An early user explicitly calls out Bay Area availability
* They are staffing onboarding in Los Angeles

### 4. They are explicitly planning a channel mix, but they are not scaling it yet

A Head of Growth job post lays out the exact set of acquisition channels they intend to test and scale: referrals, business development partnerships, community, targeted paid, and organic content.

That wording matters because it implies:

* What is working already: referrals and community word of mouth, since they say they have strong traction and a waitlist they cannot keep up with
* What is likely still exploratory: paid acquisition and scalable content, since they are hiring their first marketing lead to build the engine

### 5. Light brand presence on short form social, aimed at waitlist capture

There are public social clips promoting the concept and telling people to join the waitlist for early access.

This looks more like awareness and legitimacy marketing than a performance funnel, at least from what is visible.

## So how are they finding new users, in one sentence

Right now, Casa appears to be growing primarily through invite links and word of mouth among high trust networks, with social amplification from influential tech accounts, while rolling out city by city because onboarding and service delivery are operationally heavy.

## What I do not see evidence of, yet

* A mature SEO content engine tied to the my.casa domain, since the public site is basically a waitlist gate
* Clear signals of large scale paid advertising, beyond their stated intent to test targeted paid

## Optional next step

If you want, tell me what kind of new users you care about most, for example Bay Area homeowners versus nationwide, and I will map the most likely next acquisition steps Casa will take based on how similar local ops heavy subscription services scale.
