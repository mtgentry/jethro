<h2>Owning a home shouldn't feel like a second job</h2>
  
    <p class="h2-subheadline">

But the constant mental load of repairs often makes it feel that way. You know that list of little fixes like the squeaky door, the weird noise, or the maintenance you keep putting off? It never ends. And honestly, trying to hire someone is usually the hardest part. You spend hours chasing pros who don't respond, worrying about vague pricing, or fearing that a simple fix will turn into a huge, unplanned cost.</p>


  <p class="h2-subheadline">
It leaves you stuck in a tough spot choosing between big contractors who are booked out for months or random handymen who might ghost you halfway through. You deserve a stress-free way to get quality work done without the hiring headaches or the worry of what it’s going to cost.

<h2>Hi, I'm Mason 👋</h2>

<p class="h2-subheadline">I'm a local remodeler here in West Adams. I've spent years restoring my own 1908 Craftsman, so I speak the language of our neighborhood's homes. But I also know how stressful it is to find someone you actually trust. You shouldn't have to cross your fingers hoping a pro will show up or do the job right. I bring a remodeler's standard to the small stuff, so you can finally get those fixes done without the worry.</p>

<h2>For $99, I will handle any home maintenance task that takes 2 hours or less.</h2>






 <div class="how-it-works">

        <h2>THE DETAILS</h2>

        <div class="step">
         
        <h3>2 Hours or less</h3>
            <p>The $99 covers 2 hours of labor. But I’m not watching the clock, I’m focused on the fix. If a standard repair runs a little over time, that’s on me. I finish the job, and you still only pay $99. No surprise fees.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="step">
            
        <h3>Nearby Neighbors Only</h3>
            <p>This offer is exclusively for homeowners within 3 miles of West Adams. Hancock Park, Larchmont, Mid-Wilshire? Yes! (If you arrived here from a Facebook or Instagram ad, you are almost certainly within range). </p>
        </div>


        <div class="step">
          
        <h3>What About Parts?</h3>
            <p>The $99 covers all my labor and tools. You only pay for parts if the job actually needs them (like a new light fixture). If I can fix it with the supplies I have on hand, there’s no extra cost.</p>
        </div>
