    <h1>Routine Maintenance</h1>
    <p class="h1-subheadline">Prevent damage before it happens</p>


    <div class="how-it-works">
     
        <p class="h2-subheadline">Real peace of mind comes from knowing your home is running perfectly without you lifting a finger. Most catastrophic failures start as invisible minor issues that are easy to miss if you are busy living your life. By placing these tasks on our automatic schedule, you eliminate the mental load of remembering them and the physical effort of doing them. We prevent unexpected breakdowns and handle the recurring chores in the background so you get your free time back while your home stays in peak condition.</p>

                <h3>Garbage Disposal Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Sludge builds up under the splash guard, causing bad odors. We scour the internal blades using coarse rock salt and fresh lemons—sanitizing the unit and leaving your kitchen smelling crisp.</p>

                <h3>Dryer Vent Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Stop running your dryer twice for one load. A clogged vent traps moisture, forcing your machine to work overtime. We clear the line so your laundry dries on the first try—saving you time and lowering your electric bill.</p>

                <h3>Gutter Cleaning</h3>
                 <p>Clogged gutters can lead to roof rot and foundation damage during the rainy season. We remove all debris and flush the downspouts to ensure water flows freely away from your home, protecting your investment.</p>

                <h3>HVAC filter replacement</h3>
                <p>A clogged filter strangles your AC system and circulates dust. We replace your filters using high-grade materials to ensure maximum airflow, lower energy bills, and cleaner air for your family to breathe.</p>

                <h3>Roof Inspection</h3>
                 <p>Water damage is often invisible until it’s too late. After it rains, we use infrared thermal imaging to scan your rafters, to find any leaks before they become problems.</p>

                <h3>Water Heating Draining</h3>
                <p>Sediment buildup corrodes your tank from the inside out, leading to early failure. We flush the unit to remove hardened minerals, maintaining water pressure and preventing a premature $2,000 replacement bill.</p>

                <h3>Dishwashing Machine Cleaning</h3>
                 <p>Most homeowners don't know their dishwasher has a filter. We remove and scrub the hidden debris trap to eliminate trapped food sludge and odors, ensuring your dishes come out sparkling clean every time.</p>
